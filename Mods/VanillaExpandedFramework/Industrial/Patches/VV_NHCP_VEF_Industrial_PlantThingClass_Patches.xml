                        <description>Unlike the wild reeds that thrive only in marshy, waterlogged soils, this reed’s deep root system lets it grow on ordinary, well-drained ground. While it can still be found near wetlands, it doesn’t require constantly soggy conditions, making it a versatile crop suitable for a wider range of environments. Cultivated for its strong stalks, it provides valuable materials for construction and crafting.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; While reeds can still thrive away from water, they do so at a 25% slower rate than if there is water within 6 tiles.</description>
